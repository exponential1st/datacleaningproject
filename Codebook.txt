2. Data Description

Each record is a for each unique combination of subject ID and activity with summarized data of original sd and mean of the sensor collected.  

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Activity label, one of the 6 types. 
- Subject ID. The id of the subject. 
- summarized sensor values (78) for each record. each value is a mean value of the sd and mean value of all values in this group. 
  Naming convetion for names:
	- data name with acc are for accelaration
	- data name with gyro are for angular velocity
	- x,y,z in the data name indicates the direction. 
	- mean and std indicate if the data is summerization of mean or standard diviation data. 


Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
